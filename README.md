Problem to solve
----------------

You are given a number of inputs, mappings between inputs and outputs, and the
expected output.

The algorithm should be implemented in a SOLID manner, and be exposed in a
simple REST api.

Your assignment can be implemented in PHP or C# (any version you prefer), and
you can use any framework / libraries that you wish. Unit testing is not a
requirement, but a certain plus.

Inputs
------

```
We have the following variables:
A: bool
B: bool
C: bool
D: int
E: int
F: int
```

Outputs
-------

```
The outputs are defined as:
X: enum[S,R,T]
Y: real/float/decimal
```

Mappings
--------

```
The assignment consists of a 'base mapping', and two specialized mappings that
override / extend the base mapping.
Base
A && B && !C => X = S
A && B && C => X = R
!A && B && C => X =T
[other] => [error]
X = S => Y = D + (D * E / 100)
X = R => Y = D + (D * (E - F) / 100)
X = T => Y = D - (D * F / 100)
```

```
Specialized 1
X = R => Y = 2D + (D * E / 100)
```

```
Specialized 2
A && B && !C => X = T
A && !B && C => X = S
X = S => Y = F + D + (D * E / 100)
```

REST
--------

Please implement the algorithms in any RESTful manner, you seem fit. The services
should, however, return the resulting data as JSON.

Installation
------------

Use composer to install the dependencies

    composer install

Usage
-----

Project contains three scripts representing endpoints for each algorithm:

- base.php
- specialized1.php
- specialized2.php

Each script will reposnd to __POST__ requests with proper `Content-Type: application/json` header set.

Example input sent to base.php:

```
{"A":true,"B":true,"C":true,"D":1, "E":2,"F":3}
```

will result in an output:

```
{"X":"R","Y":0.99}
```

Tests
-----

Tests were written using __phpspec__. To run the test set just execute:

```
./bin/phpspec run -f pretty
```
